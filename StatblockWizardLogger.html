                <div id="dropzone" class="intro">
                    <p>Please, drop a <a class="appname" target="_blank" title="Link to the StatblockWizard tool" href="https://statblockwizard.github.io">StatblockWizard</a> SVG file here!</p>
                </div>
                <p>Welcome to <span class="appname">StatblockWizard Logger</span>, the tool that allows you to
                    actively use your <a class="appname" target="_blank" title="Link to the StatblockWizard tool" href="https://statblockwizard.github.io">StatblockWizard</a> statblocks to log your Role Playing Game sessions.</p>
                <p>Once you upload a StatblockWizard SVG file, this tool will analyze it and register
                    its content as actions that the character can do - ant that you can log. Just hovering your
                    mouse pointer over an action will highlight it. Sometimes that will be an entire section, but
                    sometimes only a small part will be highlighted, like a spell name in a spell list. Click the
                    highlighted area and the action will be added to the Log.</p>
                <p>Apart from actions that are in the Statblock, you will often want to add text manually. You can do
                    this in the editable text area. Clicking the 'log' button will add the typed text to the line.</p>
                <p>The app will also get your characters hit points from the statblock, and keep track of them whenever
                    your character gets damage, healing, or temporary hit points. See the 'hints' text next to the text
                    input. By the way, that hints text also hintsðŸ˜‰ at formatting options!</p>
                <p class="appinfo"><input type="button" value="show a demo log session" onclick="javascript:{RestoreFromLog(demodata());SetFocus();}" /></p>
                <h3>Other buttons:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>download.</strong>&nbsp;This downloads the current log to a .statblockwizard.log.html file. The file contains the
                        statblock, the current status of your character, and the logged events. You can print or store
                        this file for your archive.</li>
                    <li><strong>upload.</strong>&nbsp;Files you downloaded before can be uploaded later - and this will bring you right back at the
                        place where you were. <em>And</em> it will temporarily enable the 'new session using current
                        data' button!</li>
                    <li><strong>open statblock.</strong>&nbsp;Continue your current log session using a different statblock. This is the same as drag &
                        dropping a statblock.</li>
                    <li><strong>restore last session. (*)</strong>&nbsp;Even if you did not download the log, <span class="appname">StatblockWizard Logger</span>
                        will have stored the your last session in your browser's local storage. Selecting this action
                        will bring you right back. Remember though that sometimes browser data gets cleared, and the
                        session will no longer be available in this way.</li>
                    <li><strong>new session using current data. (*)</strong>&nbsp;This action will clear the log text, but retain your character's status. Also, it will increase
                        the session number by 1 - so you can directly continue where you left off.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(*) indicates that these actions are only available at appropriate times. For example, you cannot
                    restore a session unless you have saved the current session (or you just opened/refreshed the app).
